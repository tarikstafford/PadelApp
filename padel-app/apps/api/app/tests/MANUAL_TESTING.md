# Manual Test Plan: Profile Picture Upload

This document outlines the manual testing procedures for the user profile picture upload functionality.

## Test Cases

### 1. Slow Network Conditions

- **Objective:** Verify the UI provides feedback during slow uploads.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open browser developer tools and throttle the network speed (e.g., "Slow 3G").
  2. Log in to the application.
  3. Navigate to the profile page.
  4. Select a valid image to upload.
  5. Click the "Upload New Picture" button.
- **Expected Result:** The UI should display a loading indicator while the upload is in progress. The application should not time out, and the upload should eventually complete successfully.

### 2. Various Devices and Browsers

- **Objective:** Ensure the upload functionality is consistent across different platforms.
- **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions).
- **Devices:** Desktop, Tablet (e.g., iPad), Mobile (e.g., iPhone, Android).
- **Steps:**
  1. For each browser/device combination, log in to the application.
  2. Navigate to the profile page.
  3. Upload a profile picture.
- **Expected Result:** The upload functionality should work as expected on all tested platforms. The UI should be responsive and display correctly.

### 3. Accessibility Testing

- **Objective:** Verify the upload interface is accessible.
- **Steps:**
  1. Use a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to navigate the profile page.
  2. Attempt to upload a profile picture using only keyboard navigation.
- **Expected Result:**
  - All interactive elements (buttons, inputs) should be focusable and have descriptive labels.
  - The screen reader should announce the state of the upload (e.g., "Uploading...", "Upload complete").

### 4. Visual Verification

- **Objective:** Ensure the uploaded image is displayed correctly.
- **Steps:**
  1. Upload a new profile picture.
  2. Verify the new picture is displayed correctly on the profile page.
  3. Refresh the page and verify the new picture is still displayed.
  4. Log out and log back in. Verify the new picture is still displayed.
- **Expected Result:** The new profile picture should be displayed correctly in all scenarios.

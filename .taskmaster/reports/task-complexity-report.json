      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Install and Configure Railway CLI",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Railway CLI installation and configuration task into subtasks covering installation, authentication, and project linking with detailed steps for each.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward task with clear installation steps and commands. The complexity is low as it involves standard CLI installation and configuration with well-documented commands. The task is already well-structured but could be organized into logical subtasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Verify and Configure PostgreSQL Service",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the PostgreSQL service configuration into subtasks for verification, provisioning if needed, and obtaining/securing connection credentials.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves working with database services which adds some complexity. There are conditional steps (if the service doesn't exist) and credential management considerations. The task requires understanding of both Railway and PostgreSQL concepts."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Deploy FastAPI Backend Service",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the FastAPI backend deployment into subtasks covering service creation, Dockerfile configuration, environment variable setup, deployment execution, and migration verification.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it involves Docker configuration, environment variable management, and database migrations. It requires understanding of FastAPI, Docker, and Railway service configuration. Proper sequencing is critical, and there are multiple points of potential failure."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Deploy Next.js Frontend Service",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Next.js frontend deployment into subtasks for obtaining backend URL, service creation, environment configuration, and deployment with verification steps.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to the backend deployment but slightly less complex. The frontend deployment depends on the backend URL and requires Docker configuration. The task involves fewer environment variables but still requires careful configuration and verification."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Seed Database with Initial Data",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database seeding task into subtasks for script identification, execution method selection (direct or via exposed DB), and verification of seeded data.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves database operations with multiple potential approaches. There's complexity in choosing and executing the right seeding method, and potential security considerations when temporarily exposing the database. Verification is also important to ensure data integrity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Configure Custom Domain and HTTPS",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the custom domain configuration into subtasks for domain acquisition, DNS configuration, Railway domain setup, and HTTPS verification.",
      "reasoning": "Domain configuration involves external services (DNS providers) and has potential delays (DNS propagation, SSL certificate issuance). There are multiple steps that must be completed in sequence, and troubleshooting might be needed if DNS or HTTPS issues arise."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Continuous Deployment from GitHub",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the CI/CD implementation into subtasks for GitHub repository preparation, Railway-GitHub integration, service-specific deployment configuration, branch deployment rules, and pipeline testing.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up CI/CD involves multiple systems (GitHub and Railway) and requires careful configuration for each service. The monorepo structure adds complexity to the deployment configuration. Testing the pipeline is crucial and may require iterations to get right."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Perform End-to-End Application Testing",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the end-to-end testing into functional area subtasks: authentication flows, profile management, club/court discovery, booking system, game management, and cross-platform compatibility testing.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive testing is highly complex as it covers all application features and user flows. It requires creating test cases, executing them across different scenarios, and documenting results. The task is time-consuming and requires attention to detail to ensure all functionality works as expected."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Monitoring and Logging",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the monitoring implementation into subtasks for log configuration, health check endpoints, uptime monitoring, error tracking integration, and performance monitoring setup.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up comprehensive monitoring involves multiple systems and services. Each component (logging, health checks, error tracking) requires specific configuration and integration. The task requires understanding of monitoring concepts and potentially third-party services."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Create Deployment Documentation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the documentation task into subtasks for architecture documentation, environment/deployment procedures, maintenance guides, and documentation testing/validation.",
      "reasoning": "Creating comprehensive documentation requires gathering information from all previous tasks and organizing it logically. The task involves technical writing skills and ensuring the documentation is clear, complete, and accurate. It's time-consuming but critical for future maintenance."

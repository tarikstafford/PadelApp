      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of updating the User model with ELO rating and preferred position into specific implementation steps, including model changes, migration creation, schema updates, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward model update requiring changes to the database schema, model definition, and validation. The complexity is low as the requirements are well-defined with clear examples provided. The task involves adding two fields with constraints and updating related schemas."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the ELO rating calculation algorithm into subtasks covering each method, validation, edge cases, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing a mathematical algorithm with multiple methods. While the formulas are provided, proper implementation requires understanding the ELO rating system, handling edge cases, and ensuring accurate calculations. The complexity is moderate due to the algorithmic nature and need for thorough testing."

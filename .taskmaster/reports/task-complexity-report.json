      "taskTitle": "Add Cloudinary Package to Backend Dependencies",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of adding the Cloudinary package to backend dependencies into specific steps including version research, dependency addition, installation verification, and documentation updates.",
      "reasoning": "This is a straightforward dependency addition task with clear instructions. The complexity is low as it involves modifying a single file and running standard package installation commands."

      "taskTitle": "Configure Environment Variables for Cloudinary",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the environment variable configuration task into specific steps for local development setup, production configuration, security measures, and documentation updates.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up environment variables across multiple environments (development and production) and includes security considerations. It's slightly more complex than task 1 but still relatively straightforward."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create Cloudinary Configuration Module",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of the Cloudinary configuration module into steps including module implementation, error handling, application integration, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating a new module with initialization and validation logic, plus integration with the application startup process. It involves error handling and proper configuration validation, increasing its complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor File Service for Profile Pictures",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the profile picture file service refactoring into steps including Cloudinary upload implementation, error handling, file validation, testing, and ensuring backward compatibility.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves refactoring existing functionality to use a new service (Cloudinary). It requires implementing file validation, error handling, and ensuring the new implementation maintains compatibility with existing code. The complexity is moderate."

    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor File Service for Club Pictures",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the club picture file service refactoring into steps including Cloudinary upload implementation, error handling, file validation, testing, and ensuring backward compatibility.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to task 4, but slightly less complex as it follows the same pattern already established. Still requires careful implementation of file validation, error handling, and backward compatibility."

      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js configuration update for the web application into steps including configuration modification, testing with Cloudinary images, and verification in different environments.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively simple configuration change to allow Cloudinary URLs in the Next.js Image component. The main complexity comes from ensuring existing configurations are preserved and testing in different environments."

    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Update Next.js Config for Club Admin Application",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js configuration update for the club-admin application into steps including configuration modification, testing with Cloudinary images, and verification in different environments.",
      "reasoning": "Nearly identical to task 6, this involves the same configuration change but in a different application. The complexity is low as it follows the same pattern already established."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Test User Profile Picture Upload Flow",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the user profile picture upload testing into specific test cases covering API validation, frontend integration, error scenarios, performance, and end-to-end user flows.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves comprehensive testing of both backend and frontend components. It requires creating test plans, implementing automated tests, and performing manual testing across different scenarios. The complexity is high due to the breadth of testing required."
    },

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Test Club Picture Upload Flow",
      "complexityScore": 6,

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the deployment and monitoring task into specific steps including production deployment, monitoring setup, alert configuration, rollback planning, documentation updates, and post-deployment verification.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it involves deploying all previous changes to production, setting up monitoring and alerting, creating rollback plans, and ensuring everything works correctly in the production environment. It has dependencies on all previous tasks and requires careful coordination."

      "taskTitle": "Update Backend Schedule Endpoint for Date Range Support",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of updating the backend schedule endpoint for date range support into specific implementation steps, including parameter validation, query modification, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves modifying an existing endpoint with well-defined requirements. The complexity is moderate as it requires parameter validation, database query updates, and ensuring backward compatibility. The pseudo-code is already provided, making implementation straightforward."

    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Update middleware.ts for public routes",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the middleware.ts update task into specific implementation steps including: 1) Identifying the current authentication logic, 2) Modifying the route protection to exclude public routes, and 3) Testing the changes with different user scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward as it involves modifying existing code with clear requirements and example code provided. The changes are focused on a single file with a specific purpose. The main complexity comes from ensuring the authentication logic works correctly for both public and protected routes."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Create Landing Page Hero Section",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the hero section implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Component structure and responsive layout, 2) Typography and content implementation, 3) CTA button styling and functionality, and 4) Visual design elements including background and animations.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating a new component with responsive design considerations. While the example code provides a good starting point, there's design work involved in making it visually appealing and ensuring it works across different screen sizes. The complexity is moderate as it involves both functional and design aspects."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create Landing Page Features Section",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the features section implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the feature card component with icon integration, 2) Implementing the 'Coming Soon' badge functionality, 3) Building the responsive grid layout, and 4) Ensuring consistent styling with the rest of the landing page.",
      "reasoning": "This component is more complex than the hero section as it involves creating a grid of feature cards, each with icons and conditional rendering for the 'Coming Soon' badge. The responsive layout adds another layer of complexity, and ensuring visual consistency with other components requires careful attention to design details."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create Landing Page Footer",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the footer implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Basic structure with copyright and links, and 2) Responsive layout and styling consistent with the landing page design.",
      "reasoning": "This is a simple component with minimal functionality - just displaying copyright information and a few links. The example code is straightforward, and there's little complexity in terms of state management or conditional rendering. The main considerations are styling and responsiveness."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Assemble Complete Landing Page",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the landing page assembly into subtasks for: 1) Integrating all components with proper layout structure, 2) Implementing page metadata and SEO optimizations, and 3) Testing the complete page for responsiveness and visual consistency.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating previously built components rather than creating new functionality. The complexity is moderate as it requires ensuring all components work together cohesively, with proper layout and transitions. The SEO metadata implementation adds a small layer of complexity."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Create Multi-Step Form Context",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the form context implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Defining the form data interface and state structure, 2) Implementing step navigation logic, 3) Creating form data update functions, 4) Building the context provider component, and 5) Adding validation and error handling utilities.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex state management system using React Context. It requires designing a flexible data structure that can handle all form steps, implementing navigation logic, and ensuring data persistence between steps. The complexity comes from the need to handle various state transitions and validation scenarios."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Create Step 1: Admin Account Form",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the admin account form implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the form UI components with proper layout, 2) Implementing form field validation logic, 3) Connecting the form to the registration context, and 4) Adding error handling and submission functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This form component requires multiple input fields with validation logic. It needs to integrate with the form context and handle various validation scenarios. The complexity is moderate as it involves form state management, validation, and error handling, but the functionality is focused on a single step of the registration process."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Create Step 2: Club Details Form",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the club details form implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the form UI components with proper layout, 2) Implementing form field validation logic, 3) Connecting the form to the registration context with back/next navigation, and 4) Adding error handling and submission functionality.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to the admin account form, this component requires multiple input fields with validation. It has the added complexity of navigation between steps (back and next buttons). The validation logic and form structure are comparable to Step 1, making the complexity score similar."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Create Step 3: Confirmation & Finalize Form",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the confirmation form implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the summary display UI, 2) Implementing back navigation, 3) Building the submission functionality with API integration, 4) Adding loading states and error handling, and 5) Implementing success redirection logic.",
      "reasoning": "This component is more complex than the previous form steps as it not only displays a summary of all entered data but also handles the final submission to the API. It requires error handling for API calls, loading states, and success redirection. The integration with the authentication system adds another layer of complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Multi-Step Form Container",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the multi-step form container implementation into subtasks for: 1) Creating the container component structure, 2) Implementing the progress indicator UI, 3) Building the step switching logic, 4) Integrating all form step components, and 5) Testing the complete registration flow.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires integrating all the form steps into a cohesive flow with a progress indicator. It needs to coordinate with the form context to display the correct step and update the progress UI. The complexity comes from managing the overall user experience, ensuring smooth transitions between steps, and maintaining state throughout the process."

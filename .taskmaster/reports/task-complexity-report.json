      "taskTitle": "Setup Monorepo Structure",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the monorepo setup into these logical phases: 1) Initial repository and workspace configuration, 2) Directory structure and package setup, 3) Git initialization and documentation",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity as it involves setting up the foundational architecture but follows established patterns. The task is well-defined with clear steps but requires careful configuration to ensure proper workspace relationships."

      "taskTitle": "Setup Next.js Frontend with shadcn UI",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Next.js frontend setup into these components: 1) Next.js application initialization with TypeScript, 2) Tailwind CSS and shadcn UI integration, 3) Core layout components development, 4) Routing structure implementation",
      "reasoning": "Moderately complex as it involves multiple frontend technologies and configuration steps. The integration of shadcn UI with Tailwind requires careful setup, and the routing structure needs planning for the entire application."

      "taskTitle": "Setup FastAPI Backend and Database",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the backend setup into these logical components: 1) Project structure and environment setup, 2) Database connection configuration, 3) Core model implementation, 4) Migration system setup, 5) Initial data seeding",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to database design decisions that will impact the entire application. Requires setting up multiple interconnected models and ensuring proper database migration strategies. The seeding functionality adds additional complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the authentication system into these components: 1) Backend user model and security utilities, 2) Authentication endpoints implementation, 3) Frontend authentication context and state management, 4) Registration form implementation, 5) Login form implementation, 6) Protected routes and authentication persistence",
      "reasoning": "High complexity as it spans both frontend and backend with security implications. JWT implementation requires careful handling, and the authentication flow needs to be seamless across the application with proper error handling and security considerations."

      "taskTitle": "Implement User Profile Management",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the profile management into: 1) Backend profile endpoints implementation, 2) Profile picture storage solution, 3) Frontend profile view and edit components, 4) Image upload functionality",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity with the main challenge being the image upload and storage functionality. Requires integration with external services for image hosting and careful handling of form data with file uploads."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the club and court discovery into: 1) Backend endpoints with filtering and pagination, 2) Frontend club listing and search implementation, 3) Court display and availability visualization",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity focused on data presentation and filtering. The main challenges are implementing effective search/filter functionality and creating intuitive UI for displaying availability."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Court Booking System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the booking system into these components: 1) Availability calculation algorithm, 2) Booking validation and conflict prevention, 3) Backend booking endpoints, 4) Frontend date and time selection UI, 5) Booking creation flow, 6) Booking management and history views",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to the time-based nature of bookings and need to prevent conflicts. The availability calculation algorithm is particularly challenging, and the booking flow needs to handle various edge cases and provide clear feedback to users."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Game Creation and Player Invitation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the game and invitation system into: 1) Game model and endpoints implementation, 2) Invitation system backend logic, 3) User search functionality, 4) Game creation UI flow, 5) Invitation management interface",
      "reasoning": "Relatively high complexity due to the multi-user interaction aspects. The invitation system requires careful state management and notification handling. User search functionality needs to be efficient and user-friendly."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Public and Private Games",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the public/private games feature into: 1) Game model updates and privacy controls, 2) Public game discovery endpoints and filtering, 3) Join request functionality, 4) Frontend discovery and request UI",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity building on the existing game system. The main challenges are implementing effective discovery mechanisms and managing join requests with appropriate permissions and notifications."

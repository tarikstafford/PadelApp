      "taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Implement User Authentication System' task into 5 subtasks: 1) User model and database schema, 2) Authentication API endpoints (registration, login), 3) JWT implementation and middleware, 4) Frontend authentication components, and 5) Profile management functionality. Include detailed requirements and test cases for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication is a critical security feature requiring careful implementation. It involves database work, secure password handling, token management, and frontend-backend integration. The JWT implementation and proper security measures add significant complexity."

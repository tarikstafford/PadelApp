# Tournament System Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Migration File Issues
- **Problem**: Manual migration file had incorrect enum creation approach causing PostgreSQL conflicts
- **Fix**: Updated migration to use SQLAlchemy's `postgresql.ENUM` with proper `create()` and `drop()` methods
- **File**: `migrations/versions/20250627_111615_add_tournament_system.py`

### 2. Import Errors
- **Problem**: Tournament router was importing `get_current_user` which doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Updated imports to use `get_current_active_user` from `app.core.security`
- **File**: `app/routers/tournaments.py`

### 3. Enum Column Definitions
- **Problem**: Tournament models weren't using `create_enum=False` parameter
- **Fix**: Added `create_enum=False` to all SAEnum columns to match existing patterns
- **Files**: `app/models/tournament.py`

## Migration Order

The migration should run successfully now with proper enum handling:

1. Creates enum types using SQLAlchemy's enum handling
2. Creates all tournament tables with proper foreign key relationships
3. Creates indexes for performance

## Key Files Updated

### Backend Models
- `app/models/tournament.py` - Tournament system models
- `app/crud/tournament_crud.py` - CRUD operations
- `app/services/tournament_service.py` - Tournament logic and bracket generation
- `app/services/elo_rating_service.py` - Enhanced ELO system for tournaments
- `app/services/court_booking_service.py` - Court conflict prevention
- `app/routers/tournaments.py` - Tournament API endpoints
- `app/routers/users.py` - Added trophy endpoint

### Frontend Components
- Admin portal tournament management pages
- Player app tournament browsing and registration
- Trophy display component

### Database Migration
- `migrations/versions/20250627_111615_add_tournament_system.py` - Properly structured migration

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy the fixed code** - All import and model issues are resolved
2. **Run the migration** - The migration should now execute without enum conflicts
3. **Verify endpoints** - Tournament endpoints should be accessible via `/api/v1/tournaments`

## Post-Deployment Testing

1. Test tournament creation via admin portal
2. Test team registration via player app  
3. Verify court booking conflicts are prevented during tournaments
4. Test bracket generation and match result updates
5. Verify ELO rating updates after tournament matches

## Migration Rollback (if needed)

If issues persist, the migration can be rolled back safely using the provided downgrade function which properly drops enums and tables in reverse order.

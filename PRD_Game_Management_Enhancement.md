## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Team Management System

#### 1.1 Persistent Teams
**Requirements:**
- Teams can be created independent of games
- Teams maintain member relationships across multiple games
- Team creators can invite/remove members
- Teams have names, descriptions, and logos

**Database Changes:**
```sql
-- Extend existing teams table
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN logo_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id);
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;

-- New team membership table
CREATE TABLE team_memberships (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    team_id INTEGER REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'MEMBER', -- CREATOR, MEMBER
    joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    UNIQUE(team_id, user_id)
);
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/teams` - Create persistent team
- `GET /api/v1/teams` - List user's teams
- `PUT /api/v1/teams/{id}` - Update team details
- `POST /api/v1/teams/{id}/members` - Add team member
- `DELETE /api/v1/teams/{id}/members/{user_id}` - Remove member

#### 1.2 Team Game Joining
**Requirements:**
- Teams can join games as unified entities
- Game creator can invite entire teams
- Team members automatically added to game when team joins
- Team positions automatically assigned (left/right)

**Implementation:**
- Extend `GamePlayer` model with team context
- Add team invitation endpoints
- Automatic player assignment logic

### 2. Enhanced Onboarding System

#### 2.1 Backend Onboarding Tracking
**Requirements:**
- Onboarding completion stored in database
- Onboarding progress tracked per user
- Integration with existing frontend onboarding flow

**Database Changes:**
```sql
-- Add onboarding tracking to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_completed_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Optional: Detailed onboarding progress tracking
CREATE TABLE user_onboarding_progress (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    step_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    data JSONB,
    UNIQUE(user_id, step_name)
);
```

#### 2.2 Invitation-Triggered Onboarding
**Requirements:**
- Game invitations check onboarding status
- Non-onboarded users redirected to onboarding flow
- Post-onboarding automatic game addition
- Visual feedback throughout process

**Flow:**
1. User clicks invitation link
2. System checks authentication status
3. If not authenticated: Registration → Onboarding → Game Addition
4. If authenticated but not onboarded: Onboarding → Game Addition
5. If fully onboarded: Direct game addition

### 3. Game Discovery Enhancement

#### 3.1 Time-Based Filtering
**Requirements:**
- Games <1 hour away never appear in discovery
- Past games never appear in discovery
- Proper timezone handling

**Implementation:**
```python
def get_discoverable_games(current_time: datetime, buffer_minutes: int = 60):
    buffer_time = current_time + timedelta(minutes=buffer_minutes)
    return games.filter(
        Game.start_time > buffer_time,
        Game.game_status.in_([GameStatus.SCHEDULED]),
        Game.game_type == GameType.PUBLIC
    )
```

#### 3.2 Enhanced Search & Filtering
